Feature: Case Tracker Main Tests
    Requirements:
    a workspace with the process 50259961452d82bf57f4f62051572528 ("Sample Project #4 (Case Tracker)") already loaded
    there are one Output Documents in the process and one Input Document
    and workspace with the process 1455892245368ebeb11c1a5001393784 - "Process Complete BPMN" already loaded" already loaded

    Background:

    Scenario Outline: Get Case Tracker data of a Project
        And I request "project/<project>/case-tracker/property"
        And the content type is "application/json"
        Then the response status code should be 200
        And the response charset is "UTF-8"
        And the type is "object"
        And the "map_type" property equals "<map_type>"
        And the "routing_history" property equals "<routing_history>"
        And the "message_history" property equals "<message_history>"

        Examples:
